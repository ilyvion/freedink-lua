This is GNU FreeDink, a free software version of the Dink Smallwood
game engine.

This is not a new, revolutionary game engine. Instead, it tries to do
all the marvelous things the original Dink engine does but in an
improved way, with an emphasis on portability and perfect (hopefully)
backward compatibility.


Planned new features, besides running on new platforms, include new
scripting language(s), internationalization capabilities, support for
more graphical and sound formats, new graphical primitives such as
rotation (mainly to avoid the need to precalculate such special
effects), more screen color modes and a more advanced game editor.

It should also fix bugs (unless they were used as 'features' by DMod
authors - a DMod is a Dink MODule, or add-on).


When we say it is not revolutionary, this means that we won't
complexify the engine with features that were never meant for the
game. For example, free scrolling (by contrast to screen-based
scrolling) would be quite complex to add without breaking
compatibility.

If you want to make something completely new, I suggest you simply use
another game engine, such as Windemere, which is built in the spirit
of the Dink engine.

If however you just like the current engine and just want to:
- play it on your favorite operating system
- program it with a more powerful language
- get handy enhancements that do not change the engine foundations
then GNU FreeDink is for you :)

Check the doc/ directory for more technical considerations.


Last but not least, FreeDink is part of the GNU project, whose aim is
to create "GNU", a completely free (as in freedom) operating system -
whose most famous variant is GNU/Linux. A engine to play the Dink
Smallwood game and DMods is definitely a must for the GNU OS ;) Check
