Current we need to:

- implement setFrequency

keywords:
"PCM", "DSP" and "pitch-shift" (possibly in combination with "C++")
http://www.devolution.com/pipermail/sdl/2004-October/065449.html

Note: http://www.dspdimension.com/index.html?timepitch.html#intro
suggests that "pitch shift" actually means something different, and
that what we're trying to achieve is just "sample rate conversion".


I don't think that actually can be done in SDL_Mixer. Rationale (may
be wrong): I want to play a sound a looooow speed. I then need more
time, so a longer sample. The sample I'm given when developping a mix
effect has a fixed length, or at least I can't modify it. So my sound
will most likely be truncated. So much for SDL_Mixer.

However, SDL_Mixer is good for background (MIDIs and audio CDs - it's
rare to find something to read audio CDs). So we should try to use it
in combination with OpenAL (or Allegro (or...)).

 * Or switch to Allegro and keep SDL for audio CDs only (or disable
   audio CDs support)

 * Or switch to OpenAL and keep SDL_Mixer (Allegro?) only for MIDIs.

 * Or use SDL_sound to convert MIDIs to WAVs and always software-play
   them.


- Function to convert volume and panning from DX's hundreds of dB to
  the unit we'll use:

(DinkC's sound_set_vol(), update_sound() in the code)

sound_set_vol(): "The volume should be negative or zero. 0 is no
change, -1000 is about half-volume, and -10000 is extremely quiet."

Formula (keywords: dsp decibel dB volume):

 20*log10 (x/max_vol) ~> y (dB)
 ex: 20*log10 (80/128) ~> -4dB
 128: max value for a sound; SDL uses 128
 80: sound value in the WAV file
 -4dB: attenuation in decibel

In SDL, the volume is just a linear scaling (80 means something like
"multiply all sound values by 80/128)

So we need the opposite formula to get 80 from -4dB:
 x = max_vol.10^(y/20)

Ex: -1000 (hundredths of dB) => x = 128.10^(-10/20) =~ 40.

Note: -10dB should be half volume, so why isn't it 128/2 + 64? It's
because the human-ear-perceived volume is the _square_ of the sound
value.

A good place to test volume is the initial screen from the original
game (Dink's mother's house): try moving around the fireplace - volume
is somewhat proportional to the distance.


Panning: according to the DX documentation, SetPan(x) uses a dB
attenuation; left channel attenuation when positive, right channel
attenuation when negative. x ranges from -10000 to 10000.

So at first glance:
SetPan(-1000) => Mix_SetPanning(n, 255, 255.10^(-10/20))
SetPan(3000) => Mix_SetPanning(n, 255.10^(-30/20), 255)

A good place to test panning is the savegame east of the pigs in
StoneBrooks: the savegame is located left in the screen, to it should
sound louder in the left speaker (or technically, less loud in the
right speaker). Note that panning is not updated when Dink moves, it
is based on the initial location of the sprite in the screen.

- separate initsound from sfx - it's sfx+bgm

- If 100X is played, and if there's no CD, and if 100X.mid doesn't
  exist, I think the original game will play X.mid. Take that into
  account.

Note:

- soundplayeffect returns a non-0 bank number; it's used by DinkC's
  playsound(). Beware!



TiMidity++
==========

I never managed to use my sound card in MIDI mode with GNU/Linux -
however there is a program called TiMidity++ that is a MIDI->WAV
translator (software-based MIDI playing, rather than hardware-based).

SDL uses TiMidity++ automatically.

TiMidity++ by itself cannot play MIDIs, he needs a set of "patches",
which are data files defining how to reproduce the instrument
specified by the MIDI file. Once you get the patches, you also need a
configuration file, usually provided separately.

Apparently there are 2 patches set worthy to mention:

- freepats: free-as-in-freedom, included in Debian main (so compatible
  with the DFSG, the Debian Free Software Guidelines).

- eawpatches: best quality but apparently non-free, and pretty hard to
  find (TiMidity++ is surrounded by 404 pages :/). The free parts of
  eawpatches are included in freepats (on freepats.opensrc.org, you
  see in the news items that Eric A Welsh, who compiled the
  eawpatches, worked himself on sorting out the legally distributable
  files for freepats).

  There is a copy in the NetBSD package:
  ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/audio/eawpatches/README.html
  ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/alpha/2.1_2006Q3/All/eawpatches-12nb1.tgz

  SDL_Mixer also has a copy: http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
  http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/timidity/timidity.tar.gz

  Gentoo also has a copy:
  http://distfiles.gentoo.org/distfiles/eawpats12_full.tar.gz
  Install using 'emerge media-sound/timidity-eawpatches', and define
  the current patchset using:
    eselect timidity list
    eselect timidity set freepats
    eselect timidity set eawpatches

  Apparently some of eawpats is used in the Fedora timidity++ package
  (britepno.pat.bz2, pistol.pat.bz2 - added from now-defunct
  http://www.stardate.bc.ca/eawpatches/eawpats/ following
  http://bugzilla.redhat.com/50982 without much explanation), but the
  other source tarball
  (http://archive.cs.umbc.edu/pub/midia/instruments.tar.bz2) lack
  legal notices, and the documented origins are dead links, so I don't
  know what it's based on really. dance.mid plays fine so it's not
  just plain freepats.

Here is what I did to install the eawpatches from the NetBSD port to
Debian GNU/Linux Etch. First I installed the patch in the
FHS-compliant location (I checked where freepats was installed using
dpkg -L freepats):

  tar xzf eawpatches-12nb1.tgz
  mv share/eawpatches/ /usr/share/midi/

I then edited /etc/timidity/timidity.cfg:
  source /usr/share/midi/eawpatches/timidity.cfg
and /usr/share/midi/eawpatches/timidity.cfg:
  dir /usr/share/midi/eawpatches

Now you can play your favorite MIDIs decently :)
  timidity dink/Sound/dance.mid


The NetBSD documentation (in file '+DISPLAY') mentions you can test
patch files with command line options instead of messing with the
site-wide default configuration file:

  timidity -L /usr/pkg/share/eawpatches -c timidity.cfg file.mid


Another sum-up page: http://alleg.sourceforge.net/digmid.html

I tried to install the Gravis Pro patches along with the provided
configuration file, but I didn't manage to get something playing.
