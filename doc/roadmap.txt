[X] Port the game to a free compiler

The game now compiles with both VC6 and MinGW (Minimal GNU for Windows
- aka GCC). Keeping compatibily for VC6 will come in handy in case we
suspect a MinGW-specific issue and need another compiler.

[X] Port the build system to make

Both make and the Dev-Cpp semi-free IDE can be used to compile GNU
FreeDink.

[O] Clean-up the code

- Fix warnings, port it to C, make it compile -Wall -ansi -pedantic
(strict ANSI C compliance is a nice asset for portability), split it
in several files, convert the common (FreeDink and FreeDinkedit) code
to a library that could be reused by other tools (WDE).

Status: currently the code is being split and compiles without warning
under vanilla g++ (no -Wall option or anything). Most VC++ warnings
have been fixed. The code was then converted to C (not ANSI yet).

- Encapsulate sound/video/input data, so that the engine can easily
switch from a library to another.

Cleaning the code is necessary to easily port it to another libraries.

[O] Get rid of Windows-specific dependencies (ongoing)

Port the game from DirectX to SDL
(check sdl.txt for consideration on the library choice)

- Audio
  - Midi (Done)
  - Audio CD (Done: SDL_CD*)
  - WAV (Half-done: SDL_Mixer, but we lack pitch shift and volume unit
    conversion)
- Input
  - Keyboard (Neary done: a few Dinkedit glitches; decide whether to
    use unicode instead of keycodes for letters in the game)
  - Mouse (Nearly done: Ctrl+Mouse not supported in the editor)
- Graphics
  - FastFile (Done: drop-in replacement)
  - Palette (Done: SDL + custom palette functions + reproduction of DX
    limitations)
  - Bitmaps (Done: backgrounds OK, sprites Game=OK Editor=OK; using
    SDL_Image to support compressed BMPs)
  - Scaling (Done: SDL_gfx/rotozoom)
  - Fonts (In progress: SDL_ttf installed, but the font doesn't render
    exactly the same (size and weight); color from the final screen
    palette (bypass palette effects))
- Timer (Done: SDL_GetTicks)
- Frame rate limiting (Done: SDL_gfx / SDL_framerate.h)
- Embedded resources - Dinkedit sounds, newly introduced dependencies
  (Done: zzip + SFX)

[X] Handle remaining portability issues: use autoconf for this
    ("autoconfiscate"), and switch to automake along the way. Use
    Gnulib to get portable replacements.

[Milestone 1]: we have a portable game engine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Action: Make the result available. The engine relies on free software,
we can publish it.

[ ] Take care of portability issues for big-endian architectures such
as PowerPC. Make sure that a game save on big-endian can be read
correctly on little-endian (Intel...) and vice-versa.

[ ] Make (automatic) non-regression tests

This is needed to keep the compatibility. We'll need to compare
FreeDink with the Dink engine v1.07 from RTsoft. Most probably tests
will be possible for the script engine and the internal calls. If you
find a way to automatically test the game interactively, then please
contact us :)

Do not forget FreeDinkedit!! The last port resulted in a completely
broken Dinkedit. We don't want.

[ ] Add a guile interface to the game engine
[ ] Add a translator from a clean version of DinkC to Guile

We'll need to separate the (untouched) DinkC parser. Avoid messing
with the DinkC engine ever again! The problem is not that it's buggy,
but that lots of people relied on this bogosity to create scripts that
wouldn't be accepted by a clean-up/fixed version of the language.

With the translator we have a good migration path for the current
Dinkers :)

Use another extension (.fdc freedinkc?) for cleaned-up DinkC, and .scm
for Guile.

Adding new DinkC commands depend on this task.

Maybe SWIG could be used for this. It allows to define bindings one
time and generate them for several languages, including Guile, Perl
and Python.

[Milestone 2]: we have a robust framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Action: encourage people to contribute. Promote discussions and vote.

[ ] Merge 24/32 bit color support from Invertigo

Well, merge the _idea_, the code is for DirectX anyway

[ ] Merge interesting changes from redink1's reDink and toa's unDink

Some stuff need to discussed, namely bugs that are used as features in
some DMods (eg the moving background bug that erase dead sprites is
used by Mike Snyder to make a special floor where Slayers
automatically disappear when dead - I can't remember the exact DMod
though). Publicly discuss those issues (Wiki, board).

[ ] Add translation support

Needed for Dink Translation, especially to translate DMods that evolve
over time.

For DinkC, via gettext(3). Instead of looking for any strings, we
could restrict the search of translatable text to the arguments of
say*() and other user-interface functions.

We need a solution to get pictures translations (check my Mystery
Island translation for examples); we could do something like Apache's
content-negociation (much simpler though): if pic01.fr.bmp exists and
language is French, then use it instead of pic01.bmp.

[ ] Add new audio and graphics formats

[ ] Add new graphics primitives such as rotations, flip, fade to
white...

[ ] Add new audio features such as fading

[ ] Freedom

Get Seth to officially free enough of the original game (the graphics
not in the Graphics Pack, such as the original game end Boss, the
reusable (not part of the story) scripts and the sounds from the
original game) so that DMod can use completely free material. Foster
the use of free material. Avoid illegal (even if tolerated) rips. It
should be able to include legal DMods in OS distros such as Debian
GNU/Linux.

[Milestone 3]: the current engine flaws are fixed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[ ] Port existing Dink utilities, that usually only work for MS Woe.

DinkSay, Savegame editor, Dinkspell (use aspell instead of MS Word),
the DMod installer...

[ ] Port WinDinkedit to Gtk+ 2

Gtk+ 2 is cross-platform now.

[ ] Improve WinDinkedit

Make GNU FreeDink the most easiest way to create your own 2d game.

I think FreeDinkedit should not be modified further. Users tend to
like it just as it is (cf. reluctance to switch to WDE).

[Milestone 4]: FreeDink rules the world!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Action: consider commercial (but still free-as-in-freedom) use.

[ ] Maintain the stability and portability to new platforms

[ ] Add new features as needed

[ ] Hopefully a new engine will be created by then.

Create a migration path to this new engine of choice (Windemere?) with
the creation of a translator.
