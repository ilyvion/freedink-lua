TiMidity++
==========

I never managed to use my sound card in MIDI mode with GNU/Linux -
however there is a program called TiMidity++ that is a MIDI->WAV
translator (software-based MIDI playing, rather than hardware-based).

SDL uses TiMidity++ automatically.

TiMidity++ by itself cannot play MIDIs, he needs a set of "patches",
which are data files defining how to reproduce the instrument
specified by the MIDI file. Once you get the patches, you also need a
configuration file, usually provided separately.

Apparently there are 2 patches set worthy to mention:

- freepats: free-as-in-freedom, included in Debian main (so compatible
  with the DFSG, the Debian Free Software Guidelines).

- eawpatches: best quality but apparently non-free, and pretty hard to
  find (TiMidity++ is surrounded by 404 pages :/). The free parts of
  eawpatches are included in freepats (on freepats.opensrc.org, you
  see in the news items that Eric A Welsh, who compiled the
  eawpatches, worked himself on sorting out the legally distributable
  files for freepats).

  There is a copy in the NetBSD package:
  ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/packages/pkgsrc/audio/eawpatches/README.html
  ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/SunOS/i386/5.11_head/All/eawpatches-12nb3.tgz

  SDL_Mixer also has a copy: http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
  http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/timidity/timidity.tar.gz

  Gentoo also has a copy:
  http://distfiles.gentoo.org/distfiles/eawpats12_full.tar.gz
  Install using 'emerge media-sound/timidity-eawpatches', and define
  the current patchset using:
    eselect timidity list
    eselect timidity set freepats
    eselect timidity set eawpatches

  Apparently some of eawpats is used in the Fedora timidity++ package
  (britepno.pat.bz2, pistol.pat.bz2 - added from now-defunct
  http://www.stardate.bc.ca/eawpatches/eawpats/ following
  http://bugzilla.redhat.com/50982 without much explanation), but the
  other source tarball
  (http://archive.cs.umbc.edu/pub/midia/instruments.tar.bz2) lack
  legal notices, and the documented origins are dead links, so I don't
  know what it's based on really. dance.mid plays fine so it's not
  just plain freepats.


Here is what I did to install the eawpatches from the NetBSD port to
Debian GNU/Linux Etch. First I installed the patch in the
FHS-compliant location (I checked where freepats was installed using
dpkg -L freepats):

  tar xzf eawpatches-12nb3.tgz
  mv share/eawpatches/ /usr/share/midi/

I then edited /etc/timidity/timidity.cfg:
  source /usr/share/midi/eawpatches/timidity.cfg
and /usr/share/midi/eawpatches/timidity.cfg:
  dir /usr/share/midi/eawpatches

Now you can play your favorite MIDIs decently :)
  timidity dink/Sound/dance.mid


With the Gentoo archive:
  tar zf eawpats12_full.tar.gz
  mv eawpats /usr/share/midi/
I then edited /etc/timidity/timidity.cfg:
  source /usr/share/midi/eawpats/linuxconfig/timidity.cfg
then /usr/share/midi/eawpats/linuxconfig/timidity.cfg:
  dir /usr/share/midi/eawpats/


The NetBSD documentation (in file '+DISPLAY') mentions you can test
patch files with command line options instead of messing with the
site-wide default configuration file:

  timidity -L /usr/pkg/share/eawpatches -c timidity.cfg file.mid


Another sum-up page: http://alleg.sourceforge.net/digmid.html

I tried to install the Gravis Pro patches along with the provided
configuration file, but I didn't manage to get something playing.
