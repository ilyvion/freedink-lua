Valgrind is a suite of tools for debugging and profiling GNU/Linux
programs. Here are various tips to use its memory debugger:


Strip errors from SDL
=====================

Run::

 valgrind --leak-check=yes --gen-suppressions ./freedink -window -nosound

Copy paste the relevant output in::

 grep -v ^== >> /tmp/suppressions

Then give those exclusions to Valgrind::

 valgrind --leak-check=yes --suppressions=/tmp/suppressions ./freedink -window -nosound


Use with Autotools
==================

CFLAGS default to "-O2 -g", but Valgrind does not recommend using
-O2. The simplest way to avoid that is passing CFLAGS to ./configure
(not to 'make', since it would also erase the SDL include path)::

 CFLAGS="-g" ./configure
