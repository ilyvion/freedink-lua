To be able to use .ttf files as the original game does, we almost
certainly need FreeType. That's the portable solution used by OpenJDK
and Wine.

FreeType can be compiled with or without the "bytecode interpreter"
due to patents issues, which change the metrics of the fonts, and all
distros do not compile it the same (check
http://freetype.org/patents.html and
http://bugs.debian.org/447801). Passing FT_LOAD_FORCE_AUTOHINT to
FT_Load_Glyph in SDL_ttf.c is a way to avoid using the font bytecode,
resulting in consistent metrics (but decreased quality and
compatibility with Woe).

The Dink engine uses of 2 fonts:

- For game text and most editor texts: arial.ttf

  The size 18 and the weight is 600.


  The size is not the same as SDL_ttf's. The matching size for this
  particular font is 16, without antialiasing ("mono" render style),
  and you need to enable the bytecode interpreter in FreeType (without
  it, the font will be larger because of the different hinting
  (i.e. the glyph scaling interpolation)).

  This means we can't get consistent metrics across platforms. It
  would be good to find a workaround for distros such as Fedora who do
  not enable the bytecode interpreter in their packages. The most
  consistent workaround is to abolish software patents in the US, like
  in EU.

  Wine has some documentation about the size conversion in
  calc_ppem_for_height (dlls/gdi32/freetype.c):

    /* Calc. height of EM square:
     *
     * For +ve lfHeight we have
     * lfHeight = (winAscent + winDescent) * ppem / units_per_em
     * Re-arranging gives:
     * ppem = units_per_em * lfheight / (winAscent + winDescent)
     *
     * For -ve lfHeight we have
     * |lfHeight| = ppem
     * [i.e. |lfHeight| = (winAscent + winDescent - il) * ppem / units_per_em
     * with il = winAscent + winDescent - units_per_em]
     *
     */

  (We're in the positive case.)

  In theory we should load the font with FreeType manually, get the
  values for winAscent and winDescent through FT_Get_Sfnt_Table(), and
  compute the appropriate value to give to SDL_ttf. For now we'll just
  use 16 - it may not be correct for other fonts than Arial though.

  You cannot specify weight precisely with SDL_ttf, but using
  TTF_STYLE_BOLD produces exactly the right weight. If you look at the
  results, each font glyph is actually stamped twice, with a 1 pixel
  difference. We almost could do that ourselves, except that there is
  also more space ("kerning") between letters.

  Since Arial is not free, we need to find a replacement. The "Sans"
  font from the Liberation Fonts pack is *metric*-compatible with
  Arial - that is, it does _not_ look the same, but will use exactly
  the same space than Arial, and line breaks will appear at the same
  position. Since we also have to reimplement the line-break
  algorithm, this may not worth it. Instead, we might use another
  font, that is not perfectly metric-compatible, but that would
  actually look like Arial. Beware, though, that if a text in dialog
  choices (in the game) needs more lines than in the original game, it
  may appear behind the other text choices. Wait&see.

- Help text, 'I' sprite info boxes in Dinkedit: while this doesn't
  show clearly in the code, it uses another font than the rest of the
  engine: the default one. Apparently when you do not explicitely call
  SelectObject() each time you get the DX context to the Dinkedit
  window, you get the default font, even if you already changed it
  before. That default font is vgasys.fon. It is not scalable, so no
  worry about size of weight.

  Wine has a close replacement for that font (fonts/system.sfd, source
  for vgasys.fon). It can be used by SDL_ttf directly.

  Note that the font line skip is not correct with those .fon: I get
  1, while it should be something like 16. There's a work-around in
  gfx_fonts.c.


Tools for testing:
- test/woefont.c: Woe source code to display text like Dink does
- ftstring from the FreeType 2 demos package
- showfont, the SDL_ttf sample program

Locating fonts
==============

Under X11, the reference tool appear to be fontconfig.

We can attempt to detect a font path using 'fontconfig'::

  $ fc-match "LiberationSans-Regular.ttf"
  LiberationSans-Regular.ttf: "Liberation Sans" "Regular"
  
  $ fc-list| grep -i liber
  Liberation Mono:style=Regular
  Liberation Sans:style=Regular
  Liberation Serif:style=Bold Italic
  Liberation Serif:style=Bold
  Liberation Mono:style=Bold Italic
  Liberation Sans:style=Bold
  Liberation Serif:style=Regular
  Liberation Sans:style=Bold Italic
  Liberation Mono:style=Bold
  Liberation Serif:style=Italic
  Liberation Mono:style=Italic
  Liberation Sans:style=Italic
  
  $ fc-list "Liberation Sans:style=Regular" file
  /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-liberation/LiberationSans-Regular.ttf:
