#Install MinGW (www.mingw.org) and MSys

Install Dev-C++ and then MSys. When MSys asks where MinGW is, point it
to the Dev-C++ directory. That way, you can use Dev-C++'s packaging
system and integrate it with MSys.

Get dx7docs.exe and dx7libhdr.exe (unknown source, cfiles/prog/win32/)
Use the Makefile

The .dsw is a workspace, use that to edit it with VC++.


Seth says the code is dirty. In practice, this means you cannot
compile it g++. The idea is to fix those compilation errors first. Get
a VC++ under the hand to be able to test its behavior in the
situations where g++ won't compile.

It's no use to fix VC++'s warnings and errors. Try to only change the
minimum needed to compile the game, so we can start porting it to
SDL. Cleaning up, such as

- splitting the code in several files,
- fixing remaining warnings
- making it ANSI C-compliant
- remove unused variables
should be done only once we have the code run under SDL/GNU/Linux.


Make tests. Make tests. Make tests! Since the goal of the project is
to be backward compatible, and since we're up to non-trivially change
the code, we need to check that we didn't introduce
incompatibilities. Regression tests are not easy to perform on an
interactive programs. However, we can test each non-interactive part
independently. For example, we could start a game in memory, change a
few sprite, save the game, the check if the saved game is exactly
(modulo the timestamp) to a saved game generated likewise using the
current Dink version, that is patch dink.exe v1.07.



TODO:
mode is not initialized in dinkvar.h.
It is, I think, first initialized in dink.cpp in doInit().
process_line() from dinkvar.h also set its value.

At a point, mode needs to be properly initialized somewhere, to avoid
"duplicating" the variable in each object file that uses it.
