You can compile FreeDink using a completely free compilation
environment, even under MS Woe using MinGW.

MinGW can be used from an IDE (such as Code::Blocks), or from a
pseudo-Unix environment (MSys, Cygwin).

Note: compilation from Cygwin is not supported in the Makefile right
now, but should be in the future.

Note: FreeDink now supports cross-compilation, which is faster than
using GCC ports. Check cross.txt.


Extract the MSys tarball (there used to be an installed, but no I just
extracted msysCORE-1.0.X in C:\msys).

In principle, MinGW is installed in /mingw (it's compiled with
--prefix=/mingw). While it can work it installed in /usr or /, /mingw
is the common setup that other people expect, so we'll use that
(i.e. install MinGW in C:\msys\mingw). When selecting the components,
choose at least g++, g77 (apparently and optionaly used by libSDL) and
mingw-make.

If you want to install it somewhere else (for example, if you use the
one that comes with Code::Blocks so as to benefit of DevPaks), then
run /postinstall/pi.sh so that msys will tweak /etc/fstab accordingly.

Get DX headers and libraries. There's an archive at:
http://alleg.sourceforge.net/wip.html
http://alleg.sourceforge.net/files/dx70_mgw.zip

There's an archive for version 5 from libsdl:
http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/common/directx-devel.tar.gz

I also found dx7libhdr.exe and dx7docs.exe lying on my computer, as
self-extracting zip files; there is nothing letting me think I can
redistribute them, but if you have them, they work.


If you compile libSDL manually, it is important to compile it with DX
support to avoid delays when playing sounds. For libSDL to detect DX,
you need to place its headers and libraries in /mingw, so let's
install it there just in case.

You can also compile or grab a binary of nasm
(http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/mingw32/nasm.exe) to enable
assembly support in libSDL. Install it in /mingw/bin/.


Dependencies (SDL_*, zzip...):
You can either:

- use DevPaks (binary packages). They are original meant for Dev C++
  but Code::Blocks has a plug-in to use them (install them in your
  c:/msys/mingw path or wherever you install the MinGW ports).

- download the SDL binary distribution from libsdl.org (such as
  SDL-devel-1.2.12-mingw32.tar.gz )

- use MinGW's "ports" to get a semi-automated build (similar to a
  Gentoo Ebuild). Be sure to get the wget port first, and manually
  install the included wget.exe to /bin. By default everything is
  installed to /mingw, but you can install to /usr/local or wherever
  you install the DevPaks.

- compile them manually from MSys (./configure && make && make
  install)

- compile them from an IDE using the VC++ project file

GDB: I generally install Cygwin and use their GDB package. There's
also a MSys binary in the "Snapshot" section of the MinGW download
area (click "older releases" if you don't see it, the interface is
confusing); that version does not have readline support (no commands
history), which can be annoying.


Last but not least, you are adviced to install a woe port of Emacs
from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/ (full install, not the
-barebin one) :)
