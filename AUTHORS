Records of which significant portions were written by whom:


Shawn Betts wrote the first version of fastfile.c,
load_palette_from_bmp(), setup_palette(), load_sprite_pak(). We got
inspiration from his first SDL port attempt.


Sylvain Beucler did the rest.


Seth A. Robinson wrote the original engine, available at
