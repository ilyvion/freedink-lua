jump.wav, stop.wav
==================

The original sounds (see below) had unclear origin. I replaced them.

jump.wav: generated using sfxr
(http://www.cyd.liu.se/~tompe573/hp/project_sfxr.html). The parameters
are stored in jump.sfxr.

stop.wav: generated using Audacity and various try&test. As far as I
remember I started with a generated drum, reversed it to have 'bumps'
at the beginning and the end of the sound, then increased frequency
quite a lot, and eventually lowered the volume. The last state of the
Audacity project is in stop.aup.

Extracting wav resources from dinkedit.exe
==========================================

Dinkedit embedded sound resources in the v1.06 executable.

The resources were forgotten in v1.07, so if you noticed that sound
and application icon were missing, that's the reason :)

To extract and study them, I went the manual way. You need to get the
position and length of the data using a PE/COFF (aka .exe) analyser:

http://www.mikekohn.net/file_formats/anal_pe.php
$ ./anal_pe dinkedit106.exe

or
http://code.google.com/p/pefile/wiki/UsageExamples
$ python
>>> import pefile
>>> pe =  pefile.PE('dinkedit106.exe')
>>> print pe.dump_info()


First, all data offsets are base memory offsets, not file offsets. You
can get the link between the two in the section header:
.rsrc
VirtualAddress = 0x3B9000 = 3907584 (memory)
PointerToRawData = 0x1C800 = 120320 (file)

Then you can compute the file offset:
Resource OffsetToData = 3908016 (memory)
=> (3908016 - 3907584) + 120320 (file)
Size: 3356

Resource OffsetToData = 3911372 (memory)
=> (3911372 - 3907584) + 120320 (file)
Size: 9196

(alternatively you can look for 'RIFF' in the file using hexedit :))


Now you can extract your data:

dd if=dinkedit106.exe of=stop-orig.wav bs=1 skip=120752 count=3356
dd if=dinkedit106.exe of=jump.wav      bs=1 skip=124108 count=9196


stop-orig.wav has to be re-written using Audacity to make it
compatible with SDL_Mixer.
